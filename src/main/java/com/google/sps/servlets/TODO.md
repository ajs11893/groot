# What to do:

This is where we'll be making our Java Servlet files. In the case of our portfolio projects, this is where we had the DataServlet.java and DeleteDataServlet.java files, where we made our Comment class, and where we stored Comment data as Entities in DataStore. Use these files to handle backend / server-side functionality for this project, even if we're not "storing" anything per se.
